### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science Undergraduate from the National University of Singapore! 
I'm currently interning at ShopBack Singapore as a Software Engineering Intern.

My goal in life is to learn everything as much as I can, because why not? Knowledge is fun!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking into trying out new Open Source Projects in the next coming months!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
