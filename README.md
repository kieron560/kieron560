### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science Undergraduate from the National University of Singapore! 
I'm currently interning at Talenox as a Software Engineering Intern.

My goal in life is to learn everything as much as I can, because why not? Knowledge is fun!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking into C++ (Game Development) and Kotlin (Android Development)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
